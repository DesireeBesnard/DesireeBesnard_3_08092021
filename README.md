## Overview

### About the project

The user must be able to:
- be redirected after clicking the menu to the appropriate section
- edit text in the input field (button not functional for the moment)
- see the filters change appearance on hover
- click on the entire surface of accommodation cards
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (responsive website)

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- Font Awesome (icons)
- CSS
- Flexbox (Layout)
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Use of the Git version management system

##### Configuration
> git config --global user.name "John Doe"  
> git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

##### Main commands
> git init  
> git remote add origin url  
> git add  
> git commit -m "message"  
> git push origin main/branch

##### Branches
> *(See branches)* git branch  
> *(Switch branch)* git checkout branchname  
> *(Merge branch)* git merge branchname  
> *(Remove local)* git branch -d branchname  
> *(Remove remote)* git branch -D branchname  

##### Commits
> *(See last commits)* git log commit  
> *(Correct last commit)* git commit --amend -m "new message"  
> *(If forgotten file in last commit)* git add file then git commit --amend --no-edit  

##### Deploy a website on GitHub Pages

#### Integrate content according to a mockup
- Reproduce a structure in HTML5
- Layout an HTML page with CSS

#### Implement a responsive interface (Media queries for cell phones, and tablets)

### Continued development
- Define css variables for better visibility and easier maintenance
- Use a CSS preprocessor like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](https://lesscss.org/)
- Use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox
- Try a mobile-first workflow
- Build the site using a framework such as React to create components and avoid redundancies (cards)
